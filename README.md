This is a blackbox testing of FListString ADT.

This repository contains:
-A memo that contains a list of bugs found in the 10 implementations tested.
-The 10 implementations to be tested
-The TestFListString.java file that contains our tests

In order to run the test file, you must javac 1 of the 10 implementations
and the TestFListString.java file, then java the TestFListString.
Move to another directory and repeat the process for the other 9
implementations. This is to avoid conflicts for having more than 1
implementation of the FListString ADT while testing.
