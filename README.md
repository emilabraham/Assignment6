This is a blackbox testing of FListString ADT.

This repository contains:
-A memo that contains a list of bugs found in the 10 implementations tested.
-The 10 implementations to be tested
-The TestFListString.java file that contains our tests

Each implementation is in a separate folder to avoid naming conflicts.
In order to test the implementation, I would recommend copying the 
TestFlistString.javato each of the directories that contain an implementation. 
Then, compile boththe implementation and the TestFListString.java. 
Finally, run the TestFListString.java file.
